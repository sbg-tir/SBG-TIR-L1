C++ code goes here. Should generally be wrapped with SWIG to be callable by
python.

Right now we have ecostress_scan_mirror as an example. This should get
removed when there is real code, I just included it because it is a
particular simple class, pretty much a "hello world" to make sure we
can compile, test, and wrap this is swig.

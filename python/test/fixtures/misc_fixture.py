    while running a unit tests. Useful for tests that write out a test file
    and then try to read it.

    This fixture changes into the temporary directory, and at the end of
    the test it changes back to the current directory.

    Note that this uses the fixture tmpdir, which keeps around the last few
    temporary directories (cleaning up after a fixed number are generated).
    So if a test fails, you can look at the output at the location of tmpdir,
    e.g. /tmp/pytest-of-smyth
